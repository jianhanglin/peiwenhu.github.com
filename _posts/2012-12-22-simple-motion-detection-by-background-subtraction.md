This is a project that my team in EC551 _Advanced digital design with Verilog and FPGA_ has been doing. 

We kind of created the prototype of and due to time limit it was submitted as our final project in that class actually. 
But much more improvements are needed, so we are still planning to get it on a right and decent track.

So far what we have done can be watched here:
