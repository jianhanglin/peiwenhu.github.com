Are slaves of greed.

I don't like it.

They can't see it, like they can't pay a little bit of willpower to avoid the temptation. 

Yea, they are happy but they are happy, boring people. And for some of them who are living in 
a way they can't truly afford, that happiness lasts only for a while.

Go get some freedom. Life's too short to worry about a scratch on an iphone: D
