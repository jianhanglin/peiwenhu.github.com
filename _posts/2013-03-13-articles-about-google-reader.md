[for fun..](http://bringgooglereaderback.com)  

[google official blog](/assets/greader/official.pdf)被墙了，我只好弄成pdf  

[the verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service)这篇比较基本  

[群众反应强烈](http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/save-google-reader/)  
>Under CEO Eric Schmidt, the company's list of projects got a little out of control. When Larry Page retook the reins, he embarked on a ruthless round of slashing the stuff that wasn't working, and simplifying the design of everything else.

[The Impact to Third Party Apps](http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/google-kills-google-reader/)  
>Brent Simmons, the author of the seminal RSS app NetNewsWire and a former employee of RSS company NewsGator wrote a post detailing the coming "RSS sync apocalypse."

这个人他2月的时候写了一个文章说很奇怪谷歌为什么不把reader关了[RSS sync apocalypse.](http://inessential.com/2013/02/11/rss_sync_apocalypse_preview)  
>Part of learning to focus is learning how to shut things down. Google has done well at that — but I’m surprised that Google Reader hasn’t been shut down yet. Better a clean shut-down than an ungraceful end.

[原因是二月当时就有迹象了，谷歌放任reader出问题而不管](http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/the-googlereaderpocalypse-is-upon-us-googles-feed-reading-service-unusable-since-sunday/)  
>Google Reader, the RSS feed-reading service Google has long since benignly abandoned, has gone completely mad, and Google has yet to acknowledge the problem even as it heads into its second day of unusability. 

[二月那次事件的另一篇报道](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/02/11/noticing-issues-with-google-reader-today-youre-not-the-only-one/)  

[这篇](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Google-Reader-Is-Closing-And-People-Are-4352901.php)里说，twitter CEO 在做twitter CEO之前在一家叫FeedBurner的公司做CEO,
然后那家公司以100million美元被谷歌收购了，后来他在twitter做CEO，结果这个文章说，就是Twitter这些毁了RSS，因为：  

>Twitter, in fact, is a large factor in what did RSS in—at least as far as consumers went. Clicking one button to follow a source is far easier than setting up an RSS feed in a news-reading app.

差不多了，别的报道也差不多是类似的
