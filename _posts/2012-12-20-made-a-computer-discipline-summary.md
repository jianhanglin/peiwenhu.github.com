Yue asked me if I can make a list on what computer skills are required in computer engineering. 
As I was also thinking about making a similar kind of survey so as to summary all the disciplines in this area, 
I made this spreadsheet, now [available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoTG8Xx0WzCHdE54NXpkRDZfYjVfRndwaUtnTlhMZXc) on Google doc, 
and authorized anybody who gets the link access to edit. 

Now a few friends of us have made their revision. 
So if interested, please feel free to help us with it: )
