Peiwen Hu(胡沛文).

I currently live in Boston, MA. I'm a computer engineering graduate student at Boston University. 

I'll probably go to Bloomberg after graduation.  

I'm a reporter at Guifabu, which, you might not have noticed, is what showed in that banner above.  

My parents live in Tianjin, China. I used to live in Handan, Tianjin, Beijing and Leipzig, Germany.
