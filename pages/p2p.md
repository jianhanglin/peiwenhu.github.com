#what interesting data structures and algorithms may be used in your project

Data structure: distributed hash table.  

Algorithms: To be determined  

#the envisioned role of each person in the group project and a tentative schedule of goals and deadlines leading up to the projectâ€™s completion

To be determined  

#potential modifications and optimizations to the system.

We decide to optimize the p2p search peers by replacing computers with embedded systems like Raspberry Pis, once the fundamental goal is achieved.  

#your testing and evaluation strategy for the project.

As the project description suggests:  

We should be able to have:  

* A Graphical User Interface for searching for one word.
* A distributed web crawler: the amount of indexing done by any one peer in the system must be capped by a user-allotted amount, no one peer should hold more than half of the database.
* Crawling the www.bu.edu domain in under three days.
* Searching the www.bu.edu domain on two peers in under 10 seconds.
* The entire system must be able to function without access to the broader Internet.
